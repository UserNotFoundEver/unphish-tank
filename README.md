# UNPHISH TANK!

This is a simple Python tool designed to analyze URLs for potential phishing characteristics. It checks URLs against a list of suspicious keywords, domains, and top-level domains (TLDs). The tool also encrypts results for added security.

## Features

- Analyzes URLs for suspicious keywords, domains, and TLDs.
- Encrypts analysis results using AES encryption.
- Decrypts results for verification purposes.

## Requirements

To run this tool, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the following packages:

- `requests` (for handling HTTP requests, if needed in the future)
- `pycryptodome` (for AES encryption and decryption)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests pycryptodome
## You may modify it as you seem fit, more encryption, api's security alerts of KNOWN domains that are currently hacked / down etc. This tool is basic but meant to be modified later for experts. We cannot post more information for the safety of all. Do your own research and the right thing.
